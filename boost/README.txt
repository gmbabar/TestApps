Installation:

  Boost download/compile option was taking too long so I gave up.

  Instead I used yum to install boost library and headers:

     bash$ sudo yum install boost

     bash$ sudo yum install boost-devel

  For future additions, try:

     bash$ yum search boost

  It should give you number of options for library selections


PATH:
  I do see header files in: /usr/include/boost
